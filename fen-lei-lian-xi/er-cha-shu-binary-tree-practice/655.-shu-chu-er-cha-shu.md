# 655. 输出二叉树

Given the `root` of a binary tree, construct a **0-indexed** `m x n` string matrix `res` that represents a **formatted layout** of the tree. The formatted layout matrix should be constructed using the following rules:

* The **height** of the tree is `height` and the number of rows `m` should be equal to `height + 1`.
* The number of columns `n` should be equal to `2height+1 - 1`.
* Place the **root node** in the **middle** of the **top row** (more formally, at location `res[0][(n-1)/2]`).
* For each node that has been placed in the matrix at position `res[r][c]`, place its **left child** at `res[r+1][c-2height-r-1]` and its **right child** at `res[r+1][c+2height-r-1]`.
* Continue this process until all the nodes in the tree have been placed.
* Any empty cells should contain the empty string `""`.

Return _the constructed matrix _`res`.

&#x20;**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 
[["","1",""],
 ["2","",""]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: 
[["","","","1","","",""],
 ["","2","","","","3",""],
 ["","","4","","","",""]]
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 210]`.
* `-99 <= Node.val <= 99`
* The depth of the tree will be in the range `[1, 10]`.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> res;
    int getDepth (TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        return max(getDepth(root->left), getDepth(root->right)) + 1;
    }
    vector<vector<string>> printTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int level = getDepth(root);
        int len = pow(2, level) -1;
        res = vector<vector<string>>(level, vector<string>(len));
        dfs(root, 0, 0, len);
        return res;
        
    }
    void dfs(TreeNode* root, int lvl, int left, int right) {
        if (!root) return;
        string s = to_string(root->val);
        int pos = left + right >> 1;
        res[lvl][pos] = s;
        dfs(root->left, lvl + 1, left, pos);
        dfs(root->right, lvl + 1, pos + 1, right);
    }
