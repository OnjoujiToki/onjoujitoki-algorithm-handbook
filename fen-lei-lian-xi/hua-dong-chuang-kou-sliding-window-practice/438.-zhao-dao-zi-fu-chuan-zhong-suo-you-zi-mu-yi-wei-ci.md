# 438. 找到字符串中所有字母异位词

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return _an array of all the start indices of _`p`_'s anagrams in _`s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104`
* `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

```clike
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        vector<int> P(255, 0);
        for (auto x: p) P[x]++;
        vector<int> S(255,0);
        vector<int>res;
        
        
        for (int i = 0 ; i < s.size(); i++) {
            S[s[i]]++;
            if (i >= p.size()) {
                // we iterated a possible anagram
                S[s[i-p.size()]]--;
            }
            if (S == P) res.push_back(i-p.size()+1);
        }   
        return res;
    }
};
```
