# 487. 最大连续1的个数 II

### 题目地址(487. Max Consecutive Ones II)

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-ii/

### 题目描述

```
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the
array if you can flip at most one 0.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 4
Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the maximum number of consecutive 1s. 
After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.


Follow up: What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream? 
In other words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too
large to hold in memory. 
Could you solve it efficiently?
```

### 思路

滑动窗口逆向思维，记录0的个数 如果大于1 就不可以移动了。

```clike

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        // 滑动窗口逆向思维，记录0的个数 如果大于1 就不可以移动了
        int curLen = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        int curZero = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) curZero++;
            while ( j <= i && curZero>1) {
                if (nums[j] == 0) curZero--;
                j++;
            }
            curLen = i - j +1;
            maxLen = max(curLen, maxLen);
        } 

        return maxLen;
    }
};
```
