# 692. 前K个高频单词

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return _the _`k`_ most frequent strings_.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 500`
* `1 <= words[i] <= 10`
* `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `k` is in the range `[1, The number of `**`unique`**` words[i]]`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?

class Solution {
public:
    // 用小根堆维护出现次数最多的k个单词 每次淘汰pq里出现最少的那个兄弟，把他替换掉。
    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {
        unordered_map<string, int> hash; //每个单词出现的次数
        typedef pair<int, string> PIS;
        // 巧妙的方式避免了字典序比较，因为比较完出现次数后会自动比较string。
        priority_queue<PIS> pq;
        for (auto& x:words) hash[x]++;
        for (auto& x: hash) {
            PIS cur(-x.second, x.first);
            pq.push(cur);
            if (pq.size() > k) pq.pop();
        }
        vector<string> res;
        while(!pq.empty()) {
            res.push_back(pq.top().second);
            pq.pop();
        }
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
